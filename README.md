# Name Generator

This repository contains a collection of scripts and programs that generate random names by combining adjectives and nouns.  It's useful for quickly creating placeholder names for servers, projects, or anything else that needs a unique identifier.

## Why

Need to name a server, or something else?  I dislike generic names like `dal2dc3c38r67`. This project aims to provide a quick and easy way to generate more interesting and memorable names.

This project started as a simple shell script and has grown to include implementations in various languages, allowing for performance comparisons and demonstrating different coding styles.

## Languages

The following languages are currently supported:

*   Bash
*   C
*   Go
*   Haskell
*   Java
*   JavaScript (synchronous and asynchronous)
*   Perl
*   Python
*   Ruby
*   Rust
*   Zsh

## Usage

Each language implementation provides a way to generate names.  Typically, this involves running the script or program from the command line.  Most implementations support the following environment variables:

*   `counto`: The number of names to generate (defaults to the terminal height).
*   `NOUN_FOLDER`: The directory containing noun files.
*   `ADJ_FOLDER`: The directory containing adjective files.
*   `NOUN_FILE`: A specific noun file to use.
*   `ADJ_FILE`: A specific adjective file to use.
*   `SEPARATOR`: The separator between the adjective and noun (defaults to "-").
*   `DEBUG`:  Enable debug output.

## Customization

To use your own words, create text files containing one word per line and place them in the `nouns` and `adjectives` directories (or specify custom directories using the environment variables).

## Testing

Run the tests using the `test.bats` script.

## Benchmarks

The `benchmark.sh` script provides performance comparisons between the different language implementations.

## Funniest Generations

Some amusing names generated by the scripts:

*   worse-bunghole
*   inappropriate-middleman
*   sordid-tool
*   heavenly-lordstanly
*   joyous-snookie
*   overrated-lunch
*   staunch-zisoux
*   artless-rebel
*   hazardous-master
*   ashamed-bimka
