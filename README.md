# Name Generator

This repository contains a simple name generator script that combines random nouns and adjectives to create unique names.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/name-generator.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd name-generator`
3. Run the script using Python: `python name-generator.py`

## Usage

The script will output a randomly generated name in the format "adjective-noun". You can run the script multiple times to generate different names.

## Customization

To add your own nouns and adjectives, create text files in the `nouns` and `adjectives` directories. Each file should contain one word per line.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* A Unix-like operating system (tested on Linux and macOS)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the following:

* Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
* Ensure that the `nouns` and `adjectives` directories are in the same directory as the script.
* Check that the text files in the `nouns` and `adjectives` directories are formatted correctly (one word per line).
